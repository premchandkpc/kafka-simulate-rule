# FlowRule Architecture Map

This is a source-backed map of the current implementation, not a target-state promise. Runtime code and tests take precedence over diagrams, roadmaps, and dated audit snapshots.

## Process startup

### API — cmd/api/main.go

1. Load and validate configuration.
2. Open storage using internal/storage and initialize the selected backend/migrations.
3. Create rule compiler and the rule, workflow, batch, and quarantine services.
4. Create the HTTP router and register rule, workflow, contract, batch, quarantine, scheduled-event and health handlers.
5. Serve HTTP and shut down when the process context is cancelled.

The API starts HTTP only. No gRPC listener/configuration exists. The default HTTP bind is loopback; Compose publishes host ports on 127.0.0.1. The /health route is liveness only. GET /ready probes the database and the NATS stream (2s timeout) and returns 503 with per-dependency status when either is down; it does not probe workers.

Security contract:
- In development/test, tenant context may be supplied using X-Tenant-ID or tenant_id for local use only.
- In non-development environments, TenantExtractor requires FLOWRULE_TRUSTED_PROXY_TOKEN, validates X-Proxy-Auth using constant-time comparison, and accepts tenant identity only from X-Authenticated-Tenant-ID. It fails closed when the token is missing or invalid.
- This is not first-party authentication. The trusted proxy must authenticate/authorize callers, strip inbound trusted headers, set the tenant header itself, and keep the API inaccessible to direct untrusted traffic.
- Workflow definitions are global platform configuration and are read-only through the tenant-facing API. Quarantine GET/replay/delete operations are tenant-scoped at repository query time. New effect quarantines inherit tenant identity from the event through the outbox, and legacy records are backfilled from authoritative outbox/execution data where available; orphan records remain unscoped. Do not expose the API to untrusted multi-tenant traffic until source tenant propagation, proxy authentication, and cross-tenant negative tests are verified.

### Worker — cmd/worker/main.go

1. Load config, start observability, and open/initialize storage.
2. Construct a NATS JetStream consumer with base subject events and the configured shard count. The adapter declares filters for events.shard.N.
3. Construct the compiler/evaluator, transactional event service, domain subscription repository, external sender and effect router.
4. Construct batch service, shard lease manager, scheduler and application.Worker.
5. Start scheduler/worker loops; on shutdown stop loops and close consumer, storage, and observability.

The effect router is part of the runtime wiring, not an optional helper: emitted child events must be published to events.shard.N using the same NUM_SHARDS as the consumer. The event type belongs in EventEnvelope.Type. Non-event command effects use the configured external destination. Service-event effects resolve a tenant-scoped active subscriber and POST the original envelope from the outbox. The callback sender disables proxies and redirects, bounds requests, and in production permits only HTTPS URLs resolving to public IPs. In development/test only, an absent effect URL may select a fake destination and HTTP/private service endpoints may be used. Other environments must fail startup if the command effect URL is absent. LeaseManager targets ceil(NUM_SHARDS/WORKER_REPLICAS) leases per worker. WORKER_REPLICAS defaults to 1 for single-worker local deployments and must be set to the actual fixed replica count on every multi-worker deployment. This makes the assumption explicit and configurable, but does not provide dynamic membership or coordinated rebalancing.

### CLI processes

- cmd/codegen is a DB-backed command that retrieves a registered contract and generates Go, Java, Protobuf or JSON Schema artifacts. It uses flags rather than subcommands; it is not a YAML-input generator.
- cmd/migrate currently supports up only. There are no implemented down/status operations.

## Event processing sequence

  participant P as Producer
  participant N as NATS JetStream
  participant W as Worker and key queue
  participant S as Event service
  participant D as Transactional storage
  participant O as Outbox publisher
  participant C as Tenant service callback
  P->>N: publish EventEnvelope to events.shard.N
  N->>W: deliver event for owned shard
  W->>W: validate envelope and obtain fencing token
  W->>S: Process(envelope, token, shard, worker)
  S->>D: begin transaction and assert lease/fencing
  S->>D: inbox lookup/insert
  S->>D: load activation and immutable revision
  S->>S: deterministic evaluation
  S->>D: find active tenant services subscribed to event type
  S->>D: write execution and outbox effects
  S->>D: mark inbox committed
  S->>D: commit
  S-->>W: committed execution
  W->>N: ACK after successful commit
  O->>D: claim pending effects
  O->>N: republish emitted child events
  O->>D: resolve active tenant service endpoint
  O->>C: POST envelope with idempotency key
  O->>D: settle or retry effect state
~~~

The event service keeps fencing validation, deduplication, evaluation persistence, execution state, service-subscriber lookup, outbox writes and inbox commit state within one transaction. A service callback is created only after a successful execution of an active rule; events without an active rule do not fan out to domain subscribers. A conflicting inbox insert with no corresponding execution must fail closed; never create a second execution to hide inconsistent state.

## Child-event routing contract

- Broker base subject is events.
- NATS subjects are events.shard.N, where N is EventEnvelope.VirtualShard(NUM_SHARDS).
- EventEnvelope.Type carries business event type such as payment.requested; it is not part of the configured broker subject.
- The effect router and scheduler must use the same base subject and shard count as the stream/consumer. A publish to a different topic does not reach consumers if it is outside the stream subject filter.
- External command effects go to the configured HTTP destination. Forward the stable idempotency key and keep outbound timeouts/destination validation in scope.
- Delivery is at-least-once. External idempotency depends on the receiving endpoint, and the overall system must not be described as exactly-once.

## Dependency direction

~~~mermaid
flowchart TD
  Entrypoints[cmd/* composition roots] --> Services[internal/services]
  Entrypoints --> Runtime[application and runtime]
  Entrypoints --> Storage[storage and adapters]
  HTTP[HTTP adapter] --> Ports[ports]
  Services --> Ports
  Services --> Domain[domain]
  Rules[rules compiler/evaluator] --> Domain
  Ports --> Domain
  Storage --> SQL[SQL adapter]
  Storage --> Mongo[Mongo adapter]
~~~

Rules:
- Domain and rules never import transport, adapters, services, or database drivers.
- Use-case services depend on domain and ports, not concrete adapters.
- Adapters implement interfaces and keep infrastructure concerns at the edge.
- EventTxRepos and RuleTxRepos are narrow transaction-scoped views; SQL/Mongo adapters own concrete transaction assertions and repository construction. The transaction port still exposes context/fencing details, which remain review debt.
- SDK generated code must not import unexported/internal server packages.

## Confirmed gaps and next steps

| Priority | Gap | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Production auth config fails closed and global contract mutations require admin JWT scope; complete resource-level authorization and cross-tenant denial coverage remain incomplete | Keep public exposure blocked until every resource path and cross-tenant negative tests are verified |
| P1 | Outbox delivery/retry/quarantine transitions now require unique claimant tokens and unexpired claims; settlement errors propagate | Keep failure-injection tests and consider transactional quarantine/outbox settlement |
| P1 | Sequential effect dispatch and fixed claim TTL | Add per-effect timeouts and bounded concurrency only after idempotency/claim recovery is verified |
| P1 | Lease allocation uses a configured fixed replica count and releases excess leases when its target shrinks; no dynamic membership/rebalancing | Keep WORKER_REPLICAS consistent across the deployment; add membership and coordinated rebalancing before autoscaling |
| P1 | Batch execution passes a zero fencing token and bypasses the key queue | BATCH_MODE is rejected unless none; integrate batch work with lease fencing and key ordering before enabling |
| P1 | Mongo adapters previously treated JSON bytes as bson.Raw | JSON payloads/source/context now use BSON binary bytes; keep BSON round-trip tests for each JSON-backed field |
| P1 | Scheduled SQL claim fields did not exist in migration 011 | Migrations 015/016 add claim and retry fields; expired claims can be reclaimed and settlement is claimant/expiry fenced |
| P2 | Scheduled event publishing retries with bounded exponential backoff and a terminal attempt limit; validate recovery and adapter parity |
| P2 | Some tenant-scoped reads/writes remain unscoped and no trusted identity exists | AuthN/AuthZ and resource-level scoping remain release blockers |
| P1 | Transaction context/fencing leaks into the ports; adapter parity is not fully proven | Validate transaction port methods and add SQL/Mongo atomicity and repository conformance tests |
| P1 | Contract tests are in-memory-only | Reuse suites against actual SQL and Mongo adapters and test transaction/unique-key semantics |
| P1 | HTTP decoding is bounded and rejects trailing JSON/multiple YAML docs, but tenant identity is still caller-controlled and resource scoping is incomplete | Implement auth-derived tenant identity and authorize every resource operation |
| P2 | Workflow service contains not-implemented definition methods | Implement intentionally or remove placeholders and use a clear repository/service boundary |
| P2 | health is liveness only and no gRPC listener exists | Separate readiness/liveness or document that only liveness is available |
| P2 | No live crash/recovery suite or benchmark evidence | Add live PostgreSQL/NATS failure injection and reproducible benchmarks |
| P2 | SQL outbox insertion is one insert per effect | Measure throughput then introduce batch insert if warranted |
| P2 | Scheduler marks every publish error terminally failed | Add retry classification, attempts and backoff, then test crash/restart recovery |
| P2 | Batch API reads are now tenant-scoped, but batch processing is not integrated with leases/key queue | Keep non-none worker batch modes rejected until a safe processing path exists |

Do not turn this table into claims of completion without changes and tests. A follow-up audit should identify the reviewed main SHA and workflow runs, and label each old finding fixed/partial/open against current source.

## Domain builds

`domains/<domain>/builds/go/` holds typed Go code generated from contracts stored in the database (`make generate-domain DOMAIN=<domain>`). Each is a separate Go module depending on `sdk/go/flowrule`; example services depend on it through `replace` directives. Run `make verify-generated` to compile them.

## Rule check API

`POST /v1/rules/check` is a dry run used by the console Rule studio. Body: `{"source": "<YAML or JSON rule set>", "event_type"?: string, "event"?: object}`. It compiles the source and, when `event` is given, evaluates it against a synthetic envelope and returns the decision (rule explanations, matched rules, effects). Nothing is persisted or activated; compile errors return HTTP 200 with `valid:false`. Implemented in `internal/services/rules/check.go`; the handler returns 501 if the rule service does not implement `ports.RuleChecker`.
