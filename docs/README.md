# FlowRule documentation

FlowRule is a Go event-driven rules runtime. Start with the root README for the development status, event lifecycle, module commands, and known security limits. AGENTS.md is the engineering guide and file-by-file package map; ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md follows the runtime wiring and dependency direction.

## Documentation index

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Current package structure, ports, adapter boundaries, process wiring and tests |
| [design.md](design.md) | Data model, transaction boundaries, consistency assumptions, state machines and failure handling |
| [operations.md](operations.md) | Local deployment, process behavior, troubleshooting and operational checklist |
| [rules.md](rules.md) | Rule JSON/YAML shape, operators, compilation, evaluation and deployment lifecycle |
| [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) | Planned work; not a list of shipped capabilities |
| [future-architecture.md](future-architecture.md) | Target-state proposal; keep separate from current behavior |
| [audit/2026-10-10-audit.md](audit/2026-10-10-audit.md) | Historical audit snapshot; revalidate items against current source |
| [audit/2026-10-11-repository-review.md](audit/2026-10-11-repository-review.md) | Current repository review, changes made and unresolved risks |

## Current HTTP routes

The authoritative route registrations are in internal/adapters/http/handlers and internal/adapters/http/router.go. Current routes include:

| Method | Path | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| POST | /v1/rules/{ruleSet}/revisions | Decode one JSON/YAML rule set, compile, and activate a revision |
| GET | /v1/rules/{ruleSet}/revisions | List revisions in the current tenant scope |
| GET | /v1/rules/{ruleSet}/revisions/{revision} | Read a revision |
| DELETE | /v1/rules/{ruleSet}/revisions/{revision} | Deactivate the rule set |
| GET | /v1/rules/active | List active rule pointers |
| POST | /v1/contracts | Register a contract schema |
| GET | /v1/contracts | List contract schemas |
| GET | /v1/contracts/{name}/{version} | Read a contract version |
| POST | /v1/contracts/{name}/{version}/generate | Generate code/schema artifacts |
| POST | /v1/workflows | Create workflow instance |
| GET | /v1/workflows | List workflow instances |
| GET | /v1/workflows/{workflowID} | Read a workflow instance |
| POST | /v1/workflows/{workflowID}/transition | Transition an instance |
| GET / POST | /v1/workflows/definitions | List/create definitions |
| GET | /v1/workflows/definitions/{workflowType} | Read a workflow definition |
| DELETE | /v1/workflows/definitions/{workflowType}/{version} | Delete a workflow definition |
| POST | /v1/batches | Create batch |

| POST | /v1/quarantine/{id}/replay | Replay a quarantined item |
| DELETE | /v1/quarantine/{id} | Delete a quarantined item |
| GET / POST | /v1/scheduled-events | List/schedule an event |
| GET / DELETE | /v1/scheduled-events/{eventID} | Read/cancel a scheduled event |
| GET | /health | Process liveness only |

Authentication/authorization and trusted tenant identity are not implemented. The current tenant middleware trusts caller-supplied header/query values. Do not expose the API to untrusted networks. The health endpoint does not check database or broker readiness.

## Configuration and development

- Environment names/defaults: [.env.example](../.env.example)
- Root build/test/check targets: [Makefile](../Makefile)
- Process and package guide: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)
- Local Compose topology: [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)

Root module checks:

~~~sh
go build ./cmd/...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
~~~

Run SDK and each example module separately because they have their own go.mod files. Tests under tests/contract and tests/integration currently use in-memory repositories/mocks; they do not constitute live PostgreSQL/NATS crash-recovery tests.

The message delivery model is at-least-once. Inbox/outbox transactions do not prove exactly-once external delivery; the receiving destination must honor the idempotency key.
