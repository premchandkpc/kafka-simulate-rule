# Repository review — 2026-10-11

## Scope and baseline

Reviewed the main-branch snapshot at commit ce533ad522a5616a9c5e0118d7d37aba00da97cc. The review covered the repository tree, root commands/configuration, Go process entrypoints, domain/ports/services, worker/key-queue/lease/scheduler flow, storage adapters, HTTP routing and middleware, code generation, deployment scripts, test layout, CI, and current architecture/audit documents. This is a source review, not proof from a production-like deployment. All validation results must come from actual workflow runs.

## Changes made in this review branch

- Fixed emitted child-event routing: worker effect publishing is now wired through the effect router; the router publishes to the same events.shard.N subject family used by the stream/consumer and uses the configured shard count rather than a hardcoded 4096/topic-derived broker subject.
- Added a regression test for the actual broker subject contract and configurable shard count.
- Aligned api/rule-schema.json with emit_event actions and valid composite predicate shapes; the compiler now rejects ambiguous multiple-composite and empty-composite predicates, with regression tests.
- Fixed the standalone SDK build discovered by expanded CI: moved the duplicate Effect declaration out of envelope.go, aligned its JetStream dependency with the supported parent NATS module, and added sdk/go/go.sum.
- Replaced the rules service N+1 ListActiveRules query with the existing activation repository List method so repository errors are propagated rather than silently skipped.
- Removed a redundant execution status update inside the event transaction by persisting the final completed status once.
- Added POST /v1/rules/{ruleSet}/revisions so documented/example rule deployment uses a real registered route. It accepts one bounded JSON or YAML rule document, normalizes YAML to JSON, validates that the body rule_set matches the route, and compiles/activates through the use-case interface.
- Bounded HTTP JSON/YAML body reads to 1 MiB and rejected extra JSON values/multiple YAML documents. Added handler regression tests for YAML, route/body mismatch, and multiple YAML documents.
- Refactored codegen and migrate CLIs to return errors through deferred cleanup. Migration CLI now gives an explicit error for unsupported down/status commands.
- Corrected example deployment scripts that called the nonexistent bin/codegen-yaml command, fixed the workflow-definition route, and made curl fail on HTTP errors. Rule files and generated artifacts remain checked-in source/output; codegen CLI operates on registered contracts.
- Aligned the local Compose environment so the worker may use its fake destination in development mode instead of exiting because production mode requires EFFECT_DESTINATION_URL.
- Removed checked-in compiled root/sample executables and added ignore entries for those build outputs.
- Expanded Go CI to cover root commands/packages plus the standalone SDK and three example modules.
- Replaced AGENTS.md with current source-backed instructions and a file-by-file map. Replaced ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md and docs/README.md with current flow/route/guarantee statements, added the root README, and replaced the generic SECURITY.md template.
- Aligned Makefile targets to the implemented codegen/migration CLI, added non-mutating format verification, removed nonexistent E2E/protobuf/rollback recipes, and stopped the clean task from clearing the user's entire Go module cache.

## Open findings requiring follow-up

### P0 — No authenticated tenant boundary

Evidence: internal/adapters/http/middleware/middleware.go still extracts X-Tenant-ID or tenant_id query parameter and falls back to default. There is no authN/authZ layer that validates tenant identity and authorizes each resource operation.

Impact: callers can choose a tenant identifier. Tenant scoping must not be treated as a security boundary.

Next step: add authentication from a trusted provider (for example verified JWT claims or mTLS identity), derive tenant identity only from verified claims, authorize all resource IDs by tenant, reject body/query tenant mismatches, and add cross-tenant denial tests. Until then, keep the API private/local.

### P1 — Outbox transitions are not fully claimant-fenced

Evidence: ports.OutboxRepository.ScheduleRetry and Quarantine do not accept claimant identity, unlike MarkDelivered. The current effect service dispatches sequentially with a fixed claim TTL; some state-transition/quarantine persistence errors are logged instead of returned.

Impact: expired/competing claimants can race updates, slow sends can exceed claim TTL, and the process may hide a failed durable status update.

Next step: pass claimant/lease token through every transition, make all transitions conditional on current claim ownership, propagate durable-state errors, add per-effect timeouts and bounded concurrency only after claim semantics are correct, and test claim expiry/competing publishers/crash recovery.

### P1 — Transaction port leaks implementation details

Evidence: ports.Transaction exposes transaction context and fencing mutators; TxRepos groups many repository interfaces; storage construction type-asserts concrete transaction implementations.

Impact: use cases know too much about transaction internals and adapter conformance is harder.

Next step: design a consumer-owned unit-of-work interface and narrower per-use-case repository sets. Preserve fencing and all-or-nothing inbox/execution/outbox semantics with regression tests before deleting legacy interfaces.

### P1 — Adapter tests do not yet prove production storage semantics

Evidence: tests/contract uses in-memory repository implementations; tests/integration also uses mocks/in-memory repositories. The default CI suite is not a live PostgreSQL/NATS crash/recovery test.

Next step: run shared contract suites against real PostgreSQL and Mongo transaction-capable configurations; add tests for uniqueness races, rollback, ACK loss, lease expiry while paused, broker restart, outbox claim expiry, and destination timeouts. Mark unsupported backend semantics explicitly.

### P1 — Request-boundary and security work remains

This review adds request size limits and strict single-document decoding, but it does not add authentication, authorization, trusted tenant identity, consistent per-tenant authorization across all endpoints, or outbound destination allowlisting. Those remain separate required changes.

### P2 — Workflow service has placeholders

Evidence: internal/services/workflow/service.go includes definition methods that return not-implemented errors, while HTTP definition handlers receive WorkflowDefinitionRepository directly.

Next step: either implement these methods with a clear repository dependency and tests or remove the misleading placeholders.

### P2 — Composition code is duplicated

Evidence: cmd/api and cmd/worker use internal/storage, while internal/factory contains a broad Mongo-oriented factory with overlapping wiring.

Next step: verify consumers and tests, choose one supported composition root, migrate callers if any, then narrow/remove the legacy factory. It was not deleted by this review.

### P2 — Operational readiness is overstated by config/names

Evidence: /health checks only process liveness; GRPC_ADDR is configured but cmd/api has no gRPC listener; cmd/migrate supports up only. These limitations are now documented, not fixed by this review.

Next step: introduce dependency-aware readiness; either implement gRPC or remove misleading config; add reversible migrations only after explicit design/tests.

### P2 — Performance and retention need measurements

Evidence: SQL outbox Insert performs one insert per effect; sequential effect delivery, table retention, hot-table constraints/indexes, p99, and throughput have not been proven with reproducible benchmarks.

Next step: benchmark realistic event/effect sizes and contention, inspect actual query plans, then make evidence-based changes. Add retention/partitioning and schema constraints through forward-only numbered migrations where appropriate.

## Verification record

This review was authored against main commit ce533ad522a5616a9c5e0118d7d37aba00da97cc; the change branch adds the source changes above. Remote file edits were committed through the GitHub API. No local test run is claimed. An early widened-CI run passed root build/tests/vet but exposed the standalone SDK's duplicate Effect declaration; that defect and its module checksums were fixed on the current branch. The final widened Go CI and default CodeQL runs must be checked at the current PR head before merging. A green build does not close the open security/storage findings above.

## Recommended order

1. Trusted auth and tenant authorization.
2. Claimant-fenced outbox transitions with failure propagation and duplicate/expiry tests.
3. Live SQL/Mongo contract suites plus PostgreSQL/NATS failure-injection tests.
4. Unit-of-work/port redesign and removal of duplicate composition.
5. Readiness, schema/retention review, benchmarks and observability SLOs.
