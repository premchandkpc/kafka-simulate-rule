# Rust worker service (experimental)

## Isolation from Go

The existing Go worker source, Dockerfile, and Compose service are preserved. Rust is an independent service built by `Dockerfile.worker-rust` and defined as the opt-in `worker-rust` Compose service. It is not selected through a switch inside the Go container.

Start the Rust service only after stopping/scaling down the Go worker, because both runtimes use the same PostgreSQL shard leases and must not compete for the same shards:

```sh
docker compose stop worker
docker compose --profile rust up --build worker-rust
```

Return to Go by stopping Rust and starting the existing worker again:

```sh
docker compose --profile rust stop worker-rust
docker compose up -d worker
```

## Module boundaries

- `src/main.rs`: process entrypoint and top-level error reporting.
- `src/config.rs`: environment parsing and validation.
- `src/runtime.rs`: lifecycle orchestration, migration bootstrap, initial lease acquisition, task supervision.
- `src/runtime/consumer.rs`: JetStream consumers, event validation, ACK/NAK decisions.
- `src/runtime/quarantine.rs`: durable quarantine writes.
- `src/runtime/effects.rs`: outbox claiming, effect routing, callback delivery and retry settlement.
- `src/runtime/scheduler.rs`: scheduled-event claiming and publication.
- `src/engine.rs`: event-processing transaction orchestration and stable event/shard contracts.
- `src/engine/persistence.rs`: inbox, active revision, execution, outbox and subscriber persistence.
- `src/engine/rules.rs`: compiled rule model, predicate evaluation, templates and action construction.
- `src/engine/lease.rs`: PostgreSQL shard lease acquisition, renewal and release.

Methods are split by responsibility so transport, persistence, scheduling, rule evaluation and configuration can be changed independently.

## Event and rule-set semantics

Rule-set authoring and activation are API/service operations backed by `rule_revisions` and `rule_activations`; this repository does not define a separate NATS rule-management event stream. Rust consumes business events whose `EventEnvelope.type` identifies the rule set and reads the active compiled revision from PostgreSQL.

The Rust service relies on the existing API service to apply the database migrations, then acquires/renews shard leases, verifies the event's shard, checks fencing and inbox deduplication in a PostgreSQL transaction, evaluates rules, persists execution/outbox rows and commits before ACK. Transient failures are retried; malformed/permanent events are quarantined. Separate loops publish outbox effects and due scheduled events.

## Current limits

- PostgreSQL only; MongoDB is unsupported.
- Existing compiled revisions are evaluated, but Rust does not yet implement a rule-authoring/compiler API or input-contract validation. Differential Go-vs-Rust tests are required.
- Fixed replica count and initial lease acquisition are implemented, but dynamic membership/rebalancing is not.
- The Go key-queue/backpressure model, complete observability/tracing and all shutdown/recovery behavior are not fully ported.
- Service callback endpoint checks do not yet resolve DNS names and pin/validate every resolved IP.
- Real PostgreSQL/NATS integration tests, crash-after-commit-before-ACK tests and stale-owner failure injection remain outstanding.

Keep Go selected until the Rust service passes parity and integration tests. Do not run both runtimes against the same shard at once.

## Local checks

```sh
cd rust-worker
cargo fmt --all
cargo test --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
