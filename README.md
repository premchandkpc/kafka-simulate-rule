# FlowRule

FlowRule is a Go-based, event-driven rules runtime. Rules are compiled into immutable revisions; a worker evaluates incoming events and commits an execution record plus resulting effects; effects are delivered asynchronously through an outbox.

> Security: do not expose the HTTP API directly to untrusted networks. Production tenant identity must come from validated JWT claims or an authenticated trusted proxy that strips and replaces trusted headers. Development-only caller-supplied tenant headers are not authentication.

## Processes

| Process | Entrypoint | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP API | cmd/api | Rule revisions/activation, workflows, contracts, batches, quarantine, scheduled events, tenant domains/services, event ingestion and tracing |
| Worker | cmd/worker | NATS JetStream consumption, shard leases/fencing, per-process key serialization, event evaluation, outbox publishing |
| Code generator | cmd/codegen | Generate Go, Java, Protobuf, and JSON Schema artifacts from a contract already registered in storage |
| Migration CLI | cmd/migrate | Apply pending migrations; only the up command is implemented |

The root module uses Go 1.26.0. Both sdk/go and the newer sdk/go/flowrule client are separate Go modules; each example application also has its own module. CI tests every module separately because nested go.mod files are not included in a parent-module ./... command.

## Event lifecycle

1. A producer publishes an EventEnvelope to the NATS subject family events.shard.N. N is computed from tenant ID and partition key using the configured shard count.
2. The worker consumes only shards for which it owns a lease. The key queue serializes work for each partition key within this worker process and can allow concurrency across keys. This alone does not guarantee end-to-end per-key ordering across redelivery, lease handoff, or concurrent outbox publishers.
3. Inside one storage transaction, the event service validates the fencing token, checks the inbox for duplicates, loads the active rule revision, evaluates rules, and writes the execution plus outbox effects.
4. The worker acknowledges the broker delivery only after the transaction commits.
5. The outbox publisher routes emitted child events back to events.shard.N. External command effects use the configured destination; domain subscribers receive matching event envelopes at their registered HTTP callback URLs. Both deliveries carry stable idempotency keys and are at-least-once.
6. The scheduler claims due scheduled events and publishes them to the same subject family.

NATS delivery is at-least-once. The inbox prevents duplicate event execution when storage constraints and transaction semantics hold. External effects are effectively-once only when the destination honors the idempotency key. Do not claim exactly-once delivery.

## Tenant domains and receiving services

The console's **Domains & services** page manages tenant-owned event domains and HTTP callback services. A domain groups event type names; a service subscribes to one or more domains. After a matching event commits a successful active-rule execution, the worker adds one service delivery per active subscriber to the same transaction's outbox. Events that have no active rule do not trigger service callbacks.

Callbacks are delivered as the original JSON event envelope using `POST` with `Content-Type: application/json`, `Idempotency-Key`, `X-FlowRule-Tenant-ID`, `X-FlowRule-Service-ID`, `X-FlowRule-Effect-ID`, and `X-FlowRule-Event-ID` headers. The effect ID identifies the durable outbox delivery and remains stable across retries; the event ID identifies the source event and is also present in the envelope. Respond with a 2xx status; other statuses and transport failures are retried by the outbox. Receivers must deduplicate because delivery is at-least-once.

Production callback URLs must use HTTPS and resolve to public IP addresses. HTTP and private destinations are accepted only when `APP_ENV` is development/test. The worker disables environment proxies, validates resolved addresses when dialing, uses a bounded timeout, and does not follow redirects. Domain/service CRUD is tenant-scoped by the request identity; caller-controlled tenant headers are only permitted by the development/test middleware.

## Run locally

Start the local development stack from the repository root:

~~~sh
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env before using non-development credentials.
docker compose config
docker compose up --build -d
~~~

Open the React operations console at http://localhost:3000. Compose starts three worker replicas by default (`WORKER_REPLICAS=3`); check them with `docker compose ps worker`. It proxies the API, worker metrics, and Loki through Docker DNS so browser clients do not need to resolve container names. API is also available at localhost:8080, NATS at localhost:4222, NATS monitoring at localhost:8222, PostgreSQL at localhost:5432, and Redis at localhost:6379. Published ports bind to 127.0.0.1 only. Promtail discovers local Docker container logs and ships them to Loki for the console Logs page. The stack uses development settings and demo credentials; do not reuse those credentials in production. See [docs/deployment-compose.md](docs/deployment-compose.md) for service discovery, environment variables, log collection, and troubleshooting.

For root-module development:

~~~sh
go build ./cmd/...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
~~~

Test the nested modules separately:

~~~sh
(cd sdk/go && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
(cd sdk/go/flowrule && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
(cd examples/banking && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
(cd examples/ecommerce && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
(cd examples/food-delivery && go test -race -count=1 ./...)
~~~

## Generated Go clients

Generating a Go target emits both the contract type and a typed client alongside it. The generated client defaults to the registered contract name as its rule set; `SendToRuleSet` and `SubscribeRuleSet` allow an explicit rule-set name. Send options such as `flowrule.WithPartitionKey`, `WithWorkflowID`, `WithCorrelationID`, and `WithHeaders` are passed through to the SDK. Consumer modules need a dependency on `github.com/flowrule/flowrule-sdk/go/flowrule`.

~~~go
client, err := flowrule.New()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer client.Close()

typed := transactioninitiated.NewClient(client)
err = typed.Send(ctx, &transactioninitiated.Initiated{
    TransactionId: "txn-123",
    AccountId:     "account-456",
}, flowrule.WithPartitionKey("account-456"))
~~~

Generated `Subscribe` methods use live core NATS subscriptions and are available only with the NATS transport. They receive matching events for the configured tenant without competing with the worker's JetStream WorkQueue consumer. They are best-effort rather than durable: events published while disconnected are not replayed, and handler failures stop the subscription without ACK/retry behavior.

Environment variable names and local defaults are documented in .env.example. API and worker startup initialize storage/migrations. Outside development/test, the worker requires EFFECT_DESTINATION_URL and fails startup if it is missing.

## Important limitations

- Production tenant resolution requires validated JWT identity or a trusted proxy token and authenticated-tenant header. The proxy boundary is not first-party authentication; do not expose the API directly to untrusted networks.
- /health is a liveness endpoint only. Use /ready for database and NATS reachability; neither endpoint proves workers are processing.
- The API starts HTTP only. No gRPC server is implemented; the SDK's gRPC transport requires a compatible server deployed separately.
- Migration rollback/status commands and live infrastructure-backed chaos tests are not implemented.
- Tests under tests/integration use mocks/in-memory repositories, not live PostgreSQL and NATS. Validate storage atomicity, redelivery, lease expiry, and crash recovery against real infrastructure before making production guarantees.
- MongoDB transaction behavior and parity must be verified for the exact deployment configuration before relying on it for the same guarantees as PostgreSQL. JSON-backed fields are stored as BSON binary bytes and covered by BSON round-trip tests; live adapter conformance tests remain outstanding.
- Scheduled-event SQL claim columns are introduced in migration 015. Expired claims can be reclaimed; list/get/cancel are tenant-filtered and cancel only pending events. Publish errors still mark scheduled events failed without retry/backoff.
- Batch reads are tenant-scoped, but batch event execution has not been integrated with owned-shard fencing and the per-key queue. Non-none BATCH_MODE values are rejected until this is fixed; do not bypass the validation guard.
- The shard lease manager currently targets NUM_SHARDS/3 per worker without membership/rebalancing, so the current implementation implicitly assumes three worker replicas. Validate all shards remain assigned before changing replica count.

## Random producer simulation

An opt-in random producer can publish 1–100 messages per simulated client through NATS JetStream using Compose service discovery. See [random producer README](examples/random-producer/README.md) for run commands, ACK semantics, shard routing, and the current limits around master election and dynamic worker membership.
